# WH40k Rulebooks

Use these URLs to import (and link) the rulebook in Rosterizer in the rulebook import dialog. Import the base 40k rulebook first in order for dependencies to resolve automatically.

If you're going to author stuff for 40k, it's wise to make it similar in structure to other 40k rulebooks.
